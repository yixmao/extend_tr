# Extended Topological Regression

## Introduction
This is the Python package of an extended version of Topological Regression (TR), a similarity-based regression framework, that is statistically grounded, computationally fast, and interpretable. This package offers flexible options for descriptor calculation, distance calculation, anchor point selection, and model configuration, allowing users to fine-tune the method to their specific research needs.
